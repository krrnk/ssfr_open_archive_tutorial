## DAW - Reaper
I use Reaper because it offers a really easy configuration of multichannel tracks. Some of the features that make multichannel work flexible are:
* Automatic creation of multichannel tracks when importing multichannel sound files.
* Up to 64 channel audio tracks.
* Drag & Drop routing.
* Easy hardware multichannel output mapping.
* Possibility to edit JSFX plug-ins with multichannel inputs and outputs.

Although Reaper is not open-source, it offers a 60$ full-feature licence for individuals, educational and non-profit organizations. Its evaluation license is also full-feature, lasts 60 days and it will let use the software after those 60 days if you are ok with a little reminder to buy a license. 
### Download
Reaper works on MacOs, Windows and Linux. You can download the your system version [here](https://www.reaper.fm/download.php).
### Installation

## VST Plug-ins
There are different ambisonic plug-ins out there. However, I have found that the ones I get the best configurations and sound from are the Aalto SPARTA VST and the IEM Ambisonic Plug-in Suite. Both of them are open-source and offer support for MacOs, Windows and Linux. 

### Aalto SPARTA
As the developers describe it, Aalto SPARTA is "a VST audio plug-in suite for spatial audio production, reproduction and visualisation"[1]. 

A full list and description of each plug-in can be found [here](http://research.spa.aalto.fi/projects/sparta_vsts/plugins.html)

I especially like the sparta_ambiDEC decoder. It offers different degrees of decoding order per frequency band and it provides real-time binaural listening of your multichannel speaker set-up. This decoder also come with numerous speaker layouts presets. 

#### Download
Download your system version of SPARTA [here](http://research.spa.aalto.fi/projects/sparta_vsts/).
#### Installation
In MacOS and Windows, unzip the file you just downloaded, double click the binary file and follow the installation instructions.
In Linux, unzip the downloaded file, open the INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS file with your text editor of choice and follow the installation instructions. 

### IEM Ambisonic Plug-in Suite
The IEM Plug-in Suite also offers many spatial tools such as encoders, decoders, rotators and visualisers among others. Withal, what I like about this suite are its audio editing tools such as a multichannel equaliser, ambisonic compressors and ambisonic delay and reverb. 

The IEM suit has a fantastic [documentation](https://plugins.iem.at/docs/) with installation guides, detailed plug-in descriptions, a reaper tutorial, an specific guide for some of their spatial tools.
